# Aetheris x402 Engine

Aetheris explores a practical payment channel for API calls and AI-agent
micropayments on Stellar. Buyers escrow tokens once in a Soroban contract, then
authorize usage with compact off-chain Ed25519 vouchers. An API server checks
each voucher without requiring an on-chain transaction for every request; a
payee can later claim the latest cumulative voucher on-chain.

## Why this is useful to Stellar

Soroban is a programmable settlement layer, but settling every tiny API request
on-chain adds avoidable latency and transaction overhead. Voucher channels move
request authorization off-chain while leaving custody and final settlement in
Soroban escrow. That gives API providers and autonomous agents a testable path
to usage-based payments using Stellar assets and wallets, while maintaining
on-chain deposit limits, expiry, signature checks, and refunds.

The design is intentionally honest about its boundary: it removes a chain
transaction per request, not all cost or trust. Buyers still pay for channel
opening, payees pay to claim, and the service must verify the channel and
prevent voucher replay.

## How the MVP works

1. Connect Freighter and open a Soroban channel, depositing a test asset and
   binding a delegate Ed25519 public key.
2. Request a protected endpoint. The Express server returns HTTP 402 with a
   base64-encoded x402 V2 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` object.
3. Sign a domain-separated cumulative voucher in the browser and retry with
   `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
4. The server checks the live channel over Soroban RPC, verifies the voucher,
   and atomically advances its replay cursor before granting the resource.
5. The dashboard keeps the latest voucher in memory. The configured payee can
   switch Freighter to its account and submit that voucher through the contract.
   After expiry, the payer can refund the remaining escrow.

See [architecture](./docs/architecture.md) and the exact
[voucher byte format](./docs/voucher-format.md) and
[contract API](./docs/contract-api.md).

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.91+ and the `wasm32v1-none` target
- Stellar CLI 28 or newer, configured with a funded Testnet identity
- Node.js 24 (Node 22.13+ is supported) and npm
- Freighter browser extension for the dashboard's transaction flow

Soroban SDK is pinned to **28.0.0** in the contract manifest (the current
release verified while this project was scaffolded). Rust tests use Soroban
testutils and do not require a live network.

## Build and test

From the workspace root:

```powershell
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
stellar contract build --package aetheris-channel
```

Run API tests and type-check:

```powershell
npm.cmd ci --prefix server
npm.cmd --prefix server install-scripts approve esbuild
npm.cmd --prefix server run build
npm.cmd --prefix server test
```

Build the web dashboard:

```powershell
npm.cmd ci --prefix frontend
npm.cmd --prefix frontend install-scripts approve esbuild
npm.cmd --prefix frontend test
npm.cmd --prefix frontend run build
```

The Express/Supertest tests exercise the 402 challenge, a valid signed
voucher, replay rejection, and invalid-signature handling. Contract tests
exercise deposits, cumulative settlement, replay/overdraw rejection, refunds,
and the pause switch.

## Local configuration

Copy the examples to ignored local environment files:

```powershell
Copy-Item server\.env.example server\.env
Copy-Item frontend\.env.example frontend\.env.local
```

Set these values before starting the server:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SOROBAN_CONTRACT_ID` | Deployed channel contract (`C...`) |
| `SOROBAN_TOKEN_ID` | Testnet token contract used for escrow |
| `PAY_TO` | Channel payee address (`G...`) |
| `SOROBAN_SOURCE_ACCOUNT` | Public Testnet account used to simulate read-only channel queries |
| `STELLAR_RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC URL (defaults to Testnet) |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated exact browser origins allowed by CORS |
| `REQUEST_PRICE` | Smallest token units charged per API call; default `100` |
| `REPLAY_DATABASE` | Local SQLite cursor path; default `./data/replay.sqlite` |

Set the corresponding `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_CONTRACT_ID`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_TOKEN_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_TO`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_PAID_API_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUEST_PRICE` in
`frontend/.env.local`. The frontend and server prices must match. Use an asset
and payee that are consistent with the channel contract.

Start each process in its own terminal:

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix server run dev
npm.cmd --prefix frontend run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, connect Freighter on Testnet, and use the
dashboard. The source account configured on the server must exist on the same
network. The API's `GET /health` endpoint checks that the process is running;
`GET /paid/data` is the example paid route.

For settlement, the **payee address must be available in Freighter**, because
only that account can authorize the claim. The checked-in local demo
configuration uses the CLI deployer address as `PAY_TO`. If you want to settle
from your own Freighter account instead, set `PAY_TO` in `server/.env` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_TO` in `frontend/.env.local` to that account's public `G...`
address, then restart both processes and open a **new** channel. A channel's
payee cannot be changed after it is opened. The dashboard keeps the delegate
key and latest signed voucher in memory; keep the tab open through settlement.

## Testnet deployment

First create/fund a Stellar CLI identity and arrange a compatible Testnet token
contract. Then deploy and initialize the channel contract:

```powershell
.\scripts\deploy-testnet.ps1 -Identity aetheris-deployer
```

Or on Bash:

```bash
bash ./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh aetheris-deployer
```

The CLI identity is used to submit deployment/initialization transactions; the
admin defaults to that identity's public address. The script prints the
contract ID to copy into both local environment files. It does not create a
token, fund accounts, or write credentials to the repository.

## Reviewer walkthrough

This walkthrough reproduces the full Testnet payment flow from a fresh browser
tab. Complete the [Local configuration](#local-configuration) and
[Testnet deployment](#testnet-deployment) steps first, then start both the
server and frontend dev processes.

> **Keep the browser tab open** throughout the walkthrough. The delegate
> signing key lives only in page memory; closing or refreshing the tab discards
> it and new API calls cannot be signed for that channel. Signed vouchers are
> saved to `localStorage` so the payee can still settle after a reload via the
> recovery panel, but the signing key itself is never stored anywhere.

### Step 1 — Connect Freighter

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in a Chromium-based browser with the Freighter
   extension installed and unlocked on **Stellar Testnet**.
2. Click **Connect Freighter** in the top-right corner.
3. Approve the connection in the Freighter popup.

**Expected dashboard state:** the top-right button changes from
`Connect Freighter` to a truncated address (`GXXXX…XXXXX`). The status banner
reads *"Freighter connected on Stellar Testnet."*

---

### Step 2 — Open a payment channel

1. In the **Your payment rail** panel, confirm the wallet address, payee, and
   deposit amount are shown correctly.
2. Click **Open channel**.
3. Freighter will prompt you to sign and submit a Soroban `open_channel`
   transaction on Testnet. Approve it.
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed (the dashboard polls Soroban RPC
   for up to 30 seconds).

**Expected dashboard state:** the channel metric changes from **NOT OPEN** to
**ACTIVE**, a channel ID and expiry timestamp appear, and the **Open channel**
button becomes disabled. The status banner reads *"Channel `<id>` opened.
Delegate signing key is in this tab's memory only."*

> The delegate Ed25519 key pair is generated ephemerally in the browser. Its
> public key was bound to the channel on-chain during `open_channel`. The
> **private key exists only in this tab's JavaScript memory** — it is never
> written to disk, `localStorage`, or sent over the network.

---

### Step 3 — Call the paid API

1. In the **HTTP 402 FLOW** panel, click **Call the paid API**.
2. The dashboard sends an unauthenticated `GET /paid/data`, receives `HTTP 402`
   with a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header, signs a cumulative Ed25519 voucher
   off-chain, and retries with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
3. Repeat for as many calls as you like; each call increments the cumulative
   voucher amount.

**Expected dashboard state after each call:** the **Vouchers signed** counter
increments, **Total authorized** shows the running cumulative amount in token
units, and the status banner displays the JSON response body from the API.
The **Settle** button in the settlement box activates (if Freighter is already
on the payee account) or shows *"Connect payee wallet"* otherwise.

---

### Step 4 — Settle the voucher on-chain

Settlement is a payee action. The configured payee address is shown in the
channel panel (truncated `G…` address).

1. In Freighter, switch to the **payee account** that matches `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_TO`.
2. Click **Connect Freighter** again (the top-right button) so the dashboard
   picks up the new active account.
3. In the settlement box, the **Settle `<amount>` units** button is now active.
   Click it.
4. Approve the Soroban `settle` transaction in Freighter.

**Expected dashboard state:** the **On-chain settlement** counter updates to
the settled amount, the outstanding voucher is cleared, and the status banner
shows *"Settled `<amount>` token units on Stellar Testnet. Transaction:
`<hash>`."*

---

### Step 5 — Confirm on Stellar Testnet Explorer

Copy the transaction hash from the status banner and open it in
[Stellar Expert (Testnet)](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet) or
[Stellar Lab](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#explorer?network=test):

```
https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/<hash>
```

Verify that the transaction was applied and the contract's escrow balance
decreased by the settled amount.

---

### Ephemeral key and recovery notes

- The delegate private key is **temporary** — it does not persist across page
  reloads. Only open channels with Testnet funds you are willing to leave locked
  until channel expiry if the tab is accidentally closed before settlement.
- Each successful API call overwrites the previous voucher in `localStorage`
  (vouchers are cumulative; only the latest matters). If the page is reloaded,
  the **RECOVERY / UNSETTLED VOUCHERS** panel appears automatically with any
  saved voucher; the payee can settle directly from there without re-signing.
- After channel expiry the payer can reclaim the unclaimed escrow via the
  **Refund expired channel** button, which calls `refund` on the contract.

## Security and limitations

- Soroban checks payer authorization for deposits, payee authorization for
  settlement, and admin authorization for the circuit breaker.
- A payer explicitly binds the delegate voucher key while opening the
  channel. Vouchers are scoped to network, contract, channel, nonce, amount,
  and expiry. Escrow transfers use checks-effects-interactions.
- The server reads channel state from Soroban RPC and uses a transactional
  SQLite nonce/amount cursor. SQLite is single-host; production horizontal
  scaling requires a shared transactional store and rate limiting.
- There is no automatic batch-settlement worker, production wallet/key custody,
  dispute flow, or audited facilitator yet. Settlement is a manual payee action
  from the dashboard; the server does not hold the payee's signing key.
- The dashboard keeps the delegate private key in page memory only. Reloading
  loses it; open only demo channels with funds you are willing to leave locked
  until expiry/refund.
- Soroban state rent/TTL costs apply. Channels are limited to 30 days and state
  entries are extended on contract calls, but an RPC simulation does not commit
  a TTL extension. Review network rent parameters and expiry behavior before
  any production deployment.

Read [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) before experimenting. Testnet execution,
repository activity, Drips identity verification, and walkthrough recording
are separate operational steps; this code cannot guarantee program acceptance.
